# Landing Page Project

This project creates a landing page template for a website. It is created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It utilizes some of the newer ES6 features such as:
* Arrow functions
* Ternary Operators
* For ... Of Loops

While it is only a template it has lots of functionality. Some functionality:
* **Dynamically generated Navbar links** based on the amount of content
* **Smooth scrolling** to the generated links
* Highlighting each section when it is in view
* A _disappearing Navbar_ based on both **scrolling** and **clicking** links
* A return to top button that only appears when you've gone far enough down the document

This project was quite a challenge. I had to do a lot of research on JavaScript to get everything to work the way I wanted it to. I really have enjoyed creating this site and I'm a looking forward to learning more JavaScript in the future.
